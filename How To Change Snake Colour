Hey! If you want to change your snake's colour. I'll teach you.

First, open you VSC and go to line 13, you'll see the next code:
  pygame.draw.rect(self.window, (40, 114, 51), (self.x, self.y, 10, 10))
    (40, 114, 51) is the RGB code, in this case, green.
  
The numbers (40, 114, 51) are an RGB code, in this case, green.
You only need to search the code of the colour you want, for example blue, and change it.

The result should be something like this: pygame.draw.rect(self.window, (0, 0, 255), (self.x, self.y, 10, 10))
  (0, 0, 255) is the RGB code.
  
And it's done! Now you can change your snake's colour!
